## Mathematical Reference Retrieval Evaluation

This repository evaluates various mathematical reference retrieval algorithms on the dataset `NaturalProof`.

### Algorithms Evaluated 

- Classic methods: TF-IDF, BM25
- LLM: BERT, MathBERT, BERT-pair & BERT-joint (from natural proof paper)
- Neural: STAR (from STAR paper)
